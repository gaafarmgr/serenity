## Branching
Please implement all features in feature branches named with the template
`<type>/<name>`.  Valid types include:
  * `feature` - For use on branches that add new functionality or improvements
    to spade
  * `bug` - For use on branches that are intended to address a bug.
  
Please use the `<name>` field to reference an issue number, especially for bugs.
If you want to contribute a feature and there is no issue for it in the issue
tracker, you may use a descriptive english name for `<name>` 
(EG: `feature/new_widget`).  Favor underscores over dashes for spaces.
