# Contributing
Spade welcomes all kinds from contributions from anyone who wants to
contribute their skill and vision to the tool.  This file serves as a guide
intended to help you figure out how and what to contribute to spade.

## How do I get started?
If you haven't worked on this project, the following docs should help.
  * [Getting Started][1], some notes on getting started.
  * [Setting Up the Environment][2], so you can run spade's code locally.
  * [Documenting code][3], useful to understand how to read docs.

## I want to contribute...

### ...A bug (report/fix)
Since the project is still pretty small and our bug tracker isn't swamped with
useless crap, feel free to submit any issue you have experienced with spade or
any problems you've had with it.  Check out the following docs for more info:
  * [Life of a Bug][5].

### ...A feature
We define a feature as any code addition or modification intended to add or
improve functionality.  A feature is meant to be a discrete unit of change; try
to isolate separate components into their own features as much as possible.
The following documentation should be useful in getting up to speed with
contributing a feature:
  * [Life of a Feature][6].

### ...A documentation
If you feel documentation is lacking for a particular aspect of spade or feel
that some insight you've had might be benifical to the community, feel free to
submit documentation.  The following might be helpful:
  * [Documenting code][4].
