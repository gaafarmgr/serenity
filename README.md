# Spade
Spade is an editor and reverse engineering tool that operates directly on opaque
file-resident binary data.  Unlike other tools, Spade allows you to interact
with targets at the [file-format][1] level, meaning you can work on familar
formats (ELF, PE, etc) with the same ease as exotic and/or obfuscated formats.
Spade makes no assumptions about what kind of file you're working on, everything
is definable and modifiable by the user.

## Installing
Spade is currently not production ready, so it is not advised that
non-developers attempt to install.  Check out progress to v1 [here][2]
